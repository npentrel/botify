#Botify

_Typing is hard. Calling someone is harder._

Botify allows you to make a chatbot out of everyone you could possibly need to call, e. g. a GP. When you chat with Botify (on Skype or other platforms) you initiate a call by typing 'call +1234567891'. When the person picks up they hear a welcome message saying that the human calling them does not like phone calls and is therefore using this service which will speak for them on this call. When the person on the phone says something, this gets transcribed and the user can read what was said and respond by typing their response which will be read or to the person on the phone.
